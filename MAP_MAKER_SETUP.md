# 🗺️ Map Maker - Quick Setup

## 🚀 Getting Started

The Map Maker feature is now fully integrated into StudyHall! Here's how to use it:

## ⚡ Restart Required

**IMPORTANT:** You need to restart the backend server for the new map routes to load.

### Steps:

1. **Stop the current backend**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `node server.js`

2. **Restart the backend**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/studyhall && node server.js
   ```

3. **Frontend should auto-reload**
   - If not, the frontend is at http://localhost:3001

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

### Test the Backend API:
```bash
# Check if maps API is working
curl http://localhost:5001/api/maps

# Should return 3 default maps (Classic Track, Battle Arena, Tower Heights)
```

### Test the Frontend:
1. Login as a teacher or student
2. Click "Maps" in the navigation bar
3. You should see the map browser with default maps
