The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the StudyHall application from a broken state (Page not found) to a highly functional and feature-rich MVP. This involved a complete React frontend reconstruction based on existing documentation and backend code. Key efforts included extensive debugging and refactoring of Socket.io connections, resolving issues like player disconnections, incorrect host detection, and game progression stalls. A significant hurdle was identifying that the active backend was located in  instead of , necessitating code transfers. UI/UX was significantly enhanced with mobile responsiveness, a hamburger menu, currency synchronization, and a functional My Collection modal. The game flow, including practice mode and leaderboard, is now functional. The current immediate challenge is a Render deployment failure, stemming from npm <command>

<product_requirements>
The user initiated the project by requesting a fix for a Page not found error on Netlify for the StudyHall application, leading to a full frontend reconstruction as original files were lost. Subsequent requirements included resolving Host Game Now (Socket.io) connection issues, restoring the original kelly-green UI, ensuring Render deployment readiness, allowing games to start with one player, and general app improvements. These improvements translated into a comprehensive roadmap, leading to the implementation of a solo practice mode, UI enhancements (sound toggle, copy-to-clipboard, victory animations, mobile responsiveness, hamburger menu), accurate currency synchronization, fixing broken navigation links, implementing a user-specific dropdown menu (My Collection, Logout), and ensuring leaderboard wins are correctly calculated and displayed. The overarching goal is a stable, visually consistent, and feature-complete StudyHall application deployable on Render.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, SQLite database, Socket.io for real-time communication.
-   **Deployment:** Netlify, Render, Kubernetes/Supervisor, Nginx, environment variables.
-   **Frontend:** React (hooks, context, routing), Yarn, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend:** Node.js/Express, Socket.io, SQLite (via ).
-   **Networking:** CORS, WebSocket management, HTTP proxying, dynamic host/player handling.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application, StudyHall, is structured as a full-stack project within the  directory, initially with a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend. A critical architectural discovery during development was that the actively running backend was located in  rather than , where initial modifications were being made.

<current_work>
The StudyHall application currently has a fully functional multiplayer game, practice mode, and a responsive mobile UI. The game successfully advances through questions, awards currency, and updates leaderboard wins. Currency in the top navigation bar and player dashboards now syncs correctly after games and upon login. All identified broken navigation links have been fixed, and UI elements like the My Collection modal are now properly accessible.

The immediate focus is on resolving a Render deployment failure. The build logs indicate an Unknown command: "error"
