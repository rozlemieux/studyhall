### 🗄️ Database Structure
Three main tables:
1. **users** - Account information (username, password, role)
2. **player_data** - Student game data (currency, slimes)
3. **game_history** - Optional game tracking

## 🗄️ Database File Location

**Path:** `/tmp/studyhall/studyhall.db`

**Size:** ~20 KB (empty) to ~1 MB (with data)

**Format:** SQLite3 database file

**Backup Command:**
```bash
cp /tmp/studyhall/studyhall.db ~/studyhall_backup.db
```

---

## 🔍 Viewing Database Contents

### Method 1: SQLite CLI
```bash
cd /tmp/studyhall
sqlite3 studyhall.db

# Inside SQLite:
.tables                          # List all tables
SELECT * FROM users;             # View all users
SELECT * FROM player_data;       # View player data
.quit                           # Exit
```

### Method 2: DB Browser for SQLite (GUI)
1. Download: https://sqlitebrowser.org/
2. Open: studyhall.db
3. Browse data visually

## 📊 API Changes

### Authentication Endpoints

#### `/api/auth/register`
**Before:**
```json
{
  "username": "student1",
  "role": "student"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "username": "student1",
  "password": "password123",  // NEW!
  "role": "student"
}
```

#### `/api/auth/login`
**Before:**
```json
{
  "username": "student1"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "username": "student1",
  "password": "password123"  // NEW!
}
```

### Player Data Endpoints
All endpoints now query database instead of in-memory storage:
- `/api/player/:userId` - Get player data
- `/api/player/:userId/buy-pack` - Purchase slime pack
- `/api/player/:userId/select-slime` - Change active slime
- `/api/player/:userId/sell-slime` - Sell slime
- `/api/player/:userId/redeem-code` - Redeem easter egg code

**All endpoints now update the database automatically!**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Database is locked"
**Cause:** Multiple processes accessing database simultaneously

**Solution:** 
- Only one server instance at a time
- Wait a moment and retry
- Close any open SQLite connections

### Issue: "User not found" after server restart
**Cause:** Old in-memory data referenced

**Solution:**
- This should NOT happen with database
- If it does, check database file exists
- Verify user exists: `sqlite3 studyhall.db "SELECT * FROM users;"`

### Issue: Can't login with old accounts
**Cause:** Old in-memory accounts don't exist in database

**Solution:**
- Register new account with password
- Old accounts are not migrated automatically

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Development
1. **Keep database file**: Add to `.gitignore` but keep for testing
2. **Regular backups**: Copy database file before major changes
3. **View data**: Use SQLite CLI to inspect database contents
4. **Reset database**: Delete `.db` file to start fresh

### For Production
1. **Backup regularly**: Automate database backups
2. **Use PostgreSQL/MySQL**: For multi-user production environments
3. **Implement migrations**: Track schema changes
4. **Add session management**: Use JWT or session tokens
5. **Enable HTTPS**: Always use encrypted connections
