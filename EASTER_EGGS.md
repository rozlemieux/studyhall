## Pack System

Instead of buying individual slimes, players now purchase **packs** that contain multiple slimes:

### Available Packs

- **Common Pack** (100 coins) - 6 basic flavor slimes
- **Uncommon Pack** (300 coins) - 6 elemental slimes
- **Rare Pack** (800 coins) - 6 special patterned slimes
- **Epic Pack** (1500 coins) - 5 precious gem slimes
- **Legendary Pack** (3000 coins) - 4 cosmic slimes
- **Mythic Pack** (5000 coins) - 3 mythical creature slimes

### How Packs Work

- When you buy a pack, you receive a **random slime** from that pack
- You won't receive duplicates - only slimes you don't own yet
- Keep buying the same pack to collect all slimes from it!
- Secret slimes can only be obtained through easter egg codes (not in packs)

## Earning Currency

- Answer questions correctly during games
- Each correct answer earns you coins
- Use coins to buy more packs and expand your collection!

## Tips

- Start with Common Packs to build your collection cheaply
- Save up for higher rarity packs for more impressive slimes
- Try to find all 7 secret codes hidden throughout the site!
- The TAKOTIME easter egg was already in the original request! 🌮
